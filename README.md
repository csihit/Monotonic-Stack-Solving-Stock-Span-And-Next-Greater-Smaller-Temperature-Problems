# Monotonic-Stack-Solving-Stock-Span-And-Next-Greater-Smaller-Temperature-Problems
This project demonstrates how Monotonic Stacks can be used to efficiently solve common array-based problems such as stock prediction, temperature tracking, and comparing values on the right side of the list.

Functions Implemented:

• stock_span(prices)
Calculates how many consecutive days before each day had a lower or equal stock price.

• next_greater_to_right(arr)
Finds the next greater value on the right side for each element in the array.

• next_smaller_to_right(arr)
Finds the next smaller value on the right side for each element in the array.

• daily_temperatures(temps)
Determines how many days one must wait to get a warmer temperature.

How To Run:
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the file in the python compiler
3. Enter the number of elements and the values as instructed.
4. View the result outputs printed on screen.
